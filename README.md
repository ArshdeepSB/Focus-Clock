# Focus Clock
 Extension that asks for your attention span then asks what task you want to work on. Then creates a timer that helps you stay on track for that time. After the timer expires it will ask if the person wants to take a break or keep on working. If they choose break, then chrome screen turns turns black. After 5 minutes whenever the user goes back to the browser, it welcomes them back and repeats process. If you do choose to continue working then it will start a timer half the length of the original.
